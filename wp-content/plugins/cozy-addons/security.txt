# Reporting Instructions  
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it directly to us at support@cozythemes.com.  
We do not delegate responsibility to any third-party organizations that mishandle vulnerabilities or mislead reporters.  
All reports will be acknowledged within 48 hours, with a resolution timeline communicated shortly thereafter.  

# Third-Party Partnerships  
We carefully vet any third parties we collaborate with, such as bug bounty providers. Currently, we use **[PatchStack](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/cozy-addons)** for managed security reports.  
However, **we retain ownership of all security decisions** to ensure issues are addressed transparently and effectively.  

# Trust and Transparency  
Your security matters to us. If you encounter any problems with our vulnerability disclosure process, please contact our security team immediately to escalate the matter.
